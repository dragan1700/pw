ProcessWire API code snippets

These are various bits and pieces I have used at one point or another. 

Some of these snippets I use in almost every PW installation, others only for very specific use cases.

The first batch of snippets are quite old (5 years, i.e. PW 2.x). I don't regularly scan all those snippets and update them to the latest PW 3 dev API code-base. ProcessWire being a very robust piece of software though, I guess most code-pieces are still usable as-is today. 

If you happen to use a snippet from this repo and you find it doesn't work (anymore), or you realize it could be rewritten in a much smarter or efficient way, I'd be happy to hear your suggestions.

You can find me on the PW forum @ https://processwire.com/talk/profile/1325-dragan/
